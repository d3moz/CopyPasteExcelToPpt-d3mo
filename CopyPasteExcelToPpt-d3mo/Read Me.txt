How to Configure SlideBot:

SlideBot does the job with a little help.  <<<<<>>>>> in the comments indicates areas where you must input something such as a height, vertical position, one or more [Page Down] keystrokes, etc.
To add a new slide:
1) Copy template & paste to new taskbot

2) Address all <<<<<>>>>> call outs

3) If fetching an image instead of a range of cells, delete lines 28-31 in the SlideBot and replace with object cloning or mouse-clicks.  Once copied, change line 36 to "Paste_Image.atmx" bot instead
of "Paste_Cell_Range.atmx"

4) Follow the comments and it should only take a minute or two to configure a new slide_bot.


Areas I Struggled With:
1) Navigating  through PPT Slides, this must be done using keystrokes ([Page Down]).  A 'Go To Slide' command would be ideal.

2) Navigating Excel Spreadsheet tabs without having to 'Re-open' the spreadsheet document and assign a new session every time.  Being able to open a spreadsheet once at the beginning of the bot and 
somehow automatically establish a session for each tab would be ideal.

3) Copying a range of cells.. I accomplish this with keystrokes, which can screw up sometimes.  I would like to input a range of cells (B4:H11) and be able to copy it in a similar way to VBA.  I would 
have written a VBA script for each slide that fetches the range but it seemed silly to have 60+ vba scripts that are not re-usable. I know you can use system variable Column Number or something with 
loops after 'Get Cells' but I was unsure how to paste this variable as an enhanced metafile in PPT.

4) Being able to bulk edit delays in the workbench regardless of the type of command would be a great feature.

5) I can see this program evolving towards behaving like the the macro recorder in Excel (except using best practices, instead of worst).

6) I think I'm starting to like AAE
